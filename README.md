# Text Editor

![MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

## Description

This project required me to take an existing text editor app and add functionality for it to work as a PWA and function offline. This was done by implementing methods for storing and getting data from an IndexedDB database using the `idb` package, registering a service worker, and creating a manifest.json file.

## Installation

Clone the repository, run `npm install` to install the dependencies, and `npm start` which builds the webpack and starts the server at the same time. You can also look at the package.json for other premade scripts that make using the application much easier.

## Usage

You can access the application deployed live on Heroku here: https://text-editor-cjh.herokuapp.com/

You can also view a walkthrough video of the app's functionality, including showing the manifest, custom service worker, IndexedDB database, and PWA installation, below:
